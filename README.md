# Card-Game

My first a little more complex project using Pygame. Before learning Javascript, I initially started with Python and created this little Mau-Mau Card Game. Graphically it is kind of ugly but it was more about the logic behind it. It helped me to learn Object Oriented Programming. As it was my first real project, the code is quite messy and repetitive. Much of the control flow statements could have been summarized with functions. 

In order to play the game, download the zip file and run MauMau.py. You need to have pygame and Python3 installed on your machine though. 

If you don't, you can watch the Screenvideo.mp4 file to see how the application looks when running.
