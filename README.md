# Card-Game

My first a little more complex project using Pygame. Before learning Javascript, I initially started with Python and created this little Mau-Mau Card Game. Graphically it is kind of ugly but it was more about the logic behind it. It helped me to learn Object Oriented Programming.

Download the zip file and run MauMau.py. 

!! Important note !!: You need to have Python and pygame installed on your machine. If you don't, you can watch the Screenvideo.mp4 file to see how the application looks when it runs.
